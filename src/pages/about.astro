          Pipeline/data engineer with a cybersecurity background, focused on automation and reliable systems.

      <!-- Bio -->
      <div class="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-16">
        <p>
          I’m Dmitrii Malashikhin — a data/pipeline engineer with 3+ years of experience in cybersecurity products.
  I was born in the south of Russia, studied in Saint Petersburg, and recently moved to New York City after winning the Green Card lottery.
</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my work has been around building and operating data integrations end-to-end: researching sources, writing Python connectors,
  designing ETL pipelines, enriching and validating security data (including work with NVD), and keeping systems stable with solid CI/CD
  and pragmatic automation.
        </p>
        <p>
           Outside of work, I’m into MMA and NBA, love swimming and rollerblading, and spend way too much time exploring music.
  I’m a coffee person (espresso tonic is my favorite) and a big fan of mineral water.
  I also enjoy books, films, and photography — and I’m a strong believer in digital minimalism and simplifying life through smart automation.
