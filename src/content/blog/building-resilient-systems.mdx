Distributed systems fail in interesting ways. Here's what I've learned about building systems that stay up when things go wrong.

## Accept That Failures Happen

The first step is acknowledging that failures are inevitable. Design for failure from day one.

## Key Patterns

### Circuit Breakers

Prevent cascading failures by failing fast:

```typescript
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(request, {
  timeout: 3000,
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000,
});
```

### Retries with Backoff

Implement exponential backoff for transient failures:

```typescript
async function retryWithBackoff(fn, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000;
      await sleep(delay);
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```

### Bulkheads

Isolate components to prevent total system failure.

## Observability is Key

You can't fix what you can't see. Invest in:
- Distributed tracing
- Structured logging
- Meaningful metrics
- Real-time alerting
