Kubernetes operators extend the platform's capabilities by encoding operational knowledge into software. In this post, I'll walk through the process of building a simple operator from scratch.

## What is an Operator?

An operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. It uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes and controllers to maintain the desired state.

## Why Build Operators?

- Automate complex operational tasks
- Encode domain knowledge
- Provide self-healing capabilities
- Enable declarative management

## Getting Started

First, install the Operator SDK and scaffold a new project:

```bash
operator-sdk init --domain example.com --repo github.com/example/myoperator
operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Database
```

## Key Concepts

The operator pattern consists of:
1. **Custom Resources**: Your API objects
2. **Controllers**: Reconciliation logic
3. **Watchers**: Event handlers

## Best Practices

- Keep controllers idempotent
- Use finalizers for cleanup
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
