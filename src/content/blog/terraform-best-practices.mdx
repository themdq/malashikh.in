After years of working with Terraform in production environments, I've compiled a list of practices that help maintain sanity when managing infrastructure at scale.

## Module Structure

Organize your Terraform code into reusable modules:

```
modules/
├── networking/
├── compute/
├── database/
└── security/
```

## State Management

Remote state is non-negotiable for team environments:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

## Key Practices

1. **Use workspaces sparingly** - Prefer separate state files per environment
2. **Version your modules** - Pin to specific versions in production
3. **Implement drift detection** - Regularly run `terraform plan`
4. **Use data sources** - Reference existing resources safely

## Testing

Automated testing is crucial:
- Use `terraform validate` in CI
- Implement integration tests with Terratest
- Run security scans with tfsec
